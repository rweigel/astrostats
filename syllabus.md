# Course Information

*   **Day and Time**: Thursday from 4:30 - 7:10 pm
*   **Location**: Online
*   **Instructor**: Bob Weigel
*   **Email**: [rweigel@gmu.edu](mailto:rweigel@gmu.edu)
*   **Office Hour**: Thursday 3:30-4:30 pm.
*   **Course URL**: [http://bobweigel.net/astro590](http://bobweigel.net/astro590)
*   **Credits**: 3 (Lecture)
*   **Prerequisites**:
    *   390: Grade of B or higher in PHYS 251 or permission of instructor;
    *   590: Enrollment in a COS or VSE graduate program.
*   **Catalog Description**: Bayesian and frequentist statistical and data analysis methods applied to data and problems in astrophysics and the space sciences.

# Motivation

*   Many entry-level jobs for BS, MS, and PhD typically involve exploratory data analysis and require a basic understanding of statistics.
*   Many of our graduate students are working on data-intensive research problems.
*   Many BS, MS, and PhD students have not had a traditional statistics course as an undergraduate.

# Methods of Instruction

* In-class time will be approximately 50% lecture/demonstration and 50% in-class discussion.
* You will be asked to participate in class discussions during class and on Piazza. Talking and writing about statistics will help you understand statistics.
* Homework assignments will be ~50% hand-written and ~50% programs. I will ask students to present their solution during class and for other students to comment.
*   I give detailed solutions to homework problems. However, I will not be able to provide detailed feedback or identify many errors in your code. I will discuss general types of issues that I observed on the homework problems during class.
    *  As a result, I may ask you to meet with me to explain your reasoning. I will comment on your how you solved the problem and how you presented your results. Like ordinary writing, they can always be improved. I want you to leave this class knowing how a working scientist organizes analysis and presents results.

# Programming

* Any programming language may be used for homework and the final project. I will write my solutions in Python.
* I assume that you are proficient in Python (or another language) at the level of a B grade in PHYS 251. The topics that you should be familiar with are covered in my [notes for PHYS 251](python).
*  I have provided an extensive set of notes on Python techniques that you will use and should be familiar with.

# Textbook

Practical Statistics for Astronomers, 2nd Edition (2012), by J.V. Wall and C.R. Jenkins | [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Statistics-Astronomers-Cambridge-Observing/dp/0521732492) | [Author's web page](https://www.astro.ubc.ca/people/jvw/ASTROSTATS/index.html) |

This textbook covers modern statistical methods used in astronomy. It is not a comprehensive textbook, however. The textbook is most useful as a reference to understand the approaches and types of problems considered in the astronomical literature. For this reason, I will supplement this textbook with copies of background material. I'll typically provide two references that explain the background material.

Two general references on statistics that I highly recommend are
1. Principles of Statistics, M.G. Bulmer -- A short Dover book that covers fundamental statistical topics in and parsimonious manner. [Available used on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Principles-Statistics-Dover-Books-Mathematics/dp/0486637603) for ~$5.00.
2. Probability and Statistics for Engineering and the Sciences (8th ed), J.L. Devore -- A commonly used textbook for upper-division engineering and science majors. | [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Probability-Statistics-Engineering-Sciences-Devore/dp/0538733527) |

In the [References](#references) section of this syllabus, many additional references and resources are listed.

# Evaluation

*   **Homework**: 40% - Approximately one per week; extra problems will be assigned for students registered in 590. Most homework assignments will include at least one problem that requires the use of astronomy or space science data. Assignments are due before class starts.
*   **Midterm**: 30% - In-class and hand-written.
*   **Final project**: 30% - Students registered in 590 students will have an extra part for the final project.
*   **Final course**: Grades for undergraduates are determined from numerical course grades using 90%–100% A, 80%–90% B, 70%–80% C, 60%–70% D, < 60% F. For graduate students, 70% and lower is an F (the graduate grade scale does not have a D).

# Weekly Schedule

## January 28th

* Introductions
* Brief introduction to course
* Discussion of topics on syllabus
* **Course Logistics**; I will go over the following on the first day of class. You do not need to do anything before then.
    * Make sure that you can log on to Piazza. You should have received an email from Piazza before the start of the first class.
    * Create a GitHub account with your GMU username (the name in your email address, lowercase) and a repository named `astrostats` (lowercase). Give `rweigel` read/write permissions. If you already have a GitHub user id and would like to use it, send me it.
    * During class discussion, I will ask you to turn on your webcam. Please let me know if you have an issue with this (e.g., you are working in a room with a family in the background or are calling in from a locker room).
*   **Course comments**
    * Approximately 1/2 of the students in this class are undergraduates, the other 1/2 are graduates. We did this because this is the first time that the course has been taught. There will be an adjustment period as I figure out how best to handle differentials in experience with statistics, programming, and data analysis.
    * Ideally, this course would have a pre-requisite of an undergraduate statistics course. The motivation for offering this course was to familiarize students doing research in astronomy with modern statistical methods (Bayesian and Monte Carlo). As a result, I am going to cover the minimal amount of background needed to get to these modern methods.
*   Discussion of Chapter 1 of Wall and Jenkins
*   Python IDEs and [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) introduction
*   Review of Python
*   [HW #1](hw#hw-1) comments; due before the next class starts.
